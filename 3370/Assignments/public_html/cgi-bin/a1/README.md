In this directory lies my 3 .cgi scripts and index.html. 'index.cgi' is just printed html like Rob Guderian's implementation(almost identical).
I do not know how to make it more robust without javascript(forbidden) or css(may be allowed but does not specify).


The other two scripts insert/delete data into/from a sqlite3 db file. 'createnote.cgi' updates cookie information as well to tell the user how many notes have been created.

To run this site simply click index.html which contains a redirect to the www-test* location.
I will include it here for your ease: https://www-test.cs.umanitoba.ca/~hamptone/cgi-bin/a1/index.html


I don't know any other way to run this other than the live implementation in the link above
