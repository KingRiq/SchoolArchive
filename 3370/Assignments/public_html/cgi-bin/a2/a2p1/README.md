### Assignment 2 Part 1 by Eriq Hampton 7852830

In this directory lies my scraper.c and scraper.py.

Commands must be in this directory for them to work.

to compile scraper.c:
    
    in command line type

        clang scraper.c -o scraper

to run

    in command line type

        ./scraper <argument1> <argument2>


to run and compile scraper.py

    in command line type

        python3 scraper.py <argument1> <argument2>


for example to run both

    clang scraper -o scraper
    
    ./scraper Eriq Hampton

    python3 scraper.py Eriq Hampton

Note: Entering less than 3 arguments will simply return a statement to try again with more arguments.

Part 2 is not included in my submission at this moment.
