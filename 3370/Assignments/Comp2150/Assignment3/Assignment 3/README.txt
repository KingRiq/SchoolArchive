Compilation instructions:
1) Enter file directory. (Either folder "GUI" or "Text")
2) type: "javac Main.java" or "javac *.java" to compile
3) type: "java Main" to run

Attached are screenshots of the output.
The GUI did not seem to work on Rodents or Aviary but it worked fine on my computer and IDE.

For ease I have separated both GUI and Text based implementations. If gui does not work, the text version is already ready for you. Just enter the respective folder and follow the instructions starting from step 2.


NOTE: The program does not tell the user how it lost because the print methods are private in UI and since we cannot edit these files there is no other way to display it. To remedy this I added a print statement that tells the user.

I used inteliJ.
