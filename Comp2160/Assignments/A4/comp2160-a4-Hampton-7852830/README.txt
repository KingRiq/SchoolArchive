Compiles using make command
runs using ./main for consistency throughout the course.

I added extra output so you can see the memory being managed throughout the program I hope this isnt an issue. 

For some reason the ptr in main0.c on lines 50-53 print before the insertion method before it finishes executing.

Example:

size entered is too big for our buffer
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV
Insertion Failed
