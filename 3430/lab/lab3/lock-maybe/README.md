Lock me maybe
=============

This package contains three files:

1. A `README.md` (you're reading me right now!)
2. A `Makefile` (*that's* a `Makefile`?!)
3. `lock-maybe.c`, your starting point.

That's a `Makefile`?!
---------------------

Yeah, that's a `Makefile`.

GNU Make [knows how to build a bunch of different kinds of files] without
specifying rules/recipes. [Neat].
