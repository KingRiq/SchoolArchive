Assignment 2

*This README contains both compilation, and run instructions.*

#### Contents: shell.h, shell.c, Makefile, README.md, shellscript.sh*

## Compilation Instructions:
Type `make` to compile.
Type `make run` to run everything with my default arguments. (For ease)
Type 'make clean' to remove all the executeable files.
*Note The shellscript.sh I included has additional commands which were posted in the disscussion forum by other students. I used them to test this program
feel free to use it or your own copy (Whichever is required).*

## How to run:
For *shell* 
Type ./shell + "name_of_shellscript" to run.
`./shell script.sh` is an example of acceptable input.
`./shell` *only* is not enough arguments and the program will ask to enter more then exit failure.
